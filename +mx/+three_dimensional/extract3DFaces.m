%   Extract and reconstruct part of a 3D object to make up the new object

%   [vertexMatrix, facesMatrix, vertexConversion] = extract3DByFaces(vertices, faces, extractFaceIndices)

%       inputGifti           = the input gifti to extract the 3D object from
%       vertices, faces      = the input object as a vertex matrix (N x 3) and faces matrix (N x 3)
%       extractFaceIndices   = a vector with the indices of faces which should be extracted
%
%
%   Returns: 
%       vertexMatrix     = the new vertex matrix
%       facesMatrix      = the new faces matrix (with vertex indices that
%                          correspond to the vertexMatrix)
%       vertexConversion = the conversion table, the first column holds the
%                          old vertex indices, the second the new vertex indices
