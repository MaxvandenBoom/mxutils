%   Determine which points in 3D space are close to a set of cylinders in the same space given a specific radius,
%   splitting up the input for speed optimization (multi-threading) or memory maximization
%
%   [proximatePoints, distOnAxis, distFromAxis] = retrieveRadialProximatePoints(retrievalPoints, searchPoints, radius, splitConfig, [usePreExclusion])
%
%   retrievalPoints = the points in 3D space (n-by-3 matrix) which are being searched in (to be retrieved)
%   searchCylinders = the cylinders in 3D space (n-by-6 matrix), where each row defines a cylinder within which to search
%   radius          = the radius of the cylinders from which a retrieval point will be considered close
%   usePreExclusion = [optional, 0 or 1; default = 1) perform pre-exclusion of retrieval-points for each cylinder based on
%                     a search radius. This is beneficial when with a larger number of retrieval-points/search-cylinders, 
%                     and/or when limited memory is available; for smaller numbers of retrieval-points and search-cylinders, set
%                     this parameter to 0 
% 
%   splitConfig           = the configuration on splitting the input
%   splitConfig.numSets   = (optional) split input into x sets of 3D-points [0 = no splitting into sets]
%   splitConfig.numPoints = (optional) splits the input in sets of x 3D-points [0 = no splitting into sets]
%   splitConfig.threads   = (optional) number of threads to run the sets on (requires the
%                           set to be split using either numSets or numPoints)
%
%   
%   Returns: 
%       proximatePoints   = cell array. Each cell represents an (input)
%                           cylinder, the values in the cell are the indices
%                           of the (input) retrieval points which are within
%                           the search cylinder's radius
%       distOnAxis        = cell array. Each cell represents an (input)
%                           cylinder, the values in the cell are the distances
%                           of the retrieval points on the cylinder axis. So
%                           the distance to the start cap point (first three
%                           columns in the searchCylinder parameters) if the point
%                           would be projected by the shortest distance onto the axis
%       distFromAxis      = cell array. Each cell represents an (input)
%                           cylinder, the values in the cell are the distances
%                           of the retrieval points to the cylinder axis. So
%                           the shortest distance of the point to the axis
